# Docs

This is based on [Mintlify's starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter).

## Development

Change root directory to docs.

```
cd docs
```

Install dependencies (e.g. [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify)) to run the docs locally. To install, use the following command

```
pnpm i
```

Run the following command from the docs directory (where mint.json is)

```
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

Changes should be auto-deployed to production automatically after pushing to the main branch - through Mintlify's GitHub App (which is installed on this repo).
