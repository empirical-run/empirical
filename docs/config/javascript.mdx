Empirical can rely on a JavaScript file as config located at `empiricalrc.js`. This file
needs to export a config object as shown below.

You can use type checking with JSDoc to assist with auto-completions and type
checks in your editor.

## Create sample config

Use this shell command to create a sample JS config file which can
be edited.

```sh
npm init empiricalrun
```

## Configuration reference

```js
/** @type {import("empiricalrun").Config} */
export default {
  runs: [
    //
  ],
  dataset: {
    // 
  },
  scorers: [
    //
  ],
};
```

The exported configuration object has three high-level properties:

- `runs`: Use this to define [model providers](./models/basics)
- `dataset`: Use this to define the [scenarios to test](./dataset/basics)
- `scorers`: Use this to define [scoring functions](./scoring/basics)
