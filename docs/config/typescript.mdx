Empirical can rely on a TypeScript file as config located at `empiricalrc.ts`. This file
needs to export a config object as shown below.

We recommend using TypeScript as your code editor can help with type checks and 
auto-completions out-of-the-box as you edit the config.

## Create sample config

Use this shell command to create a sample TS config file which can
be edited.

```sh
npm init empiricalrun -- --using-ts
```

## Configuration reference

```ts empiricalrc.ts
import { Config } from "empiricalrun";

const config: Config = {
  "runs": [
    // Define model providers to run against
  ],
  "dataset": {
    // Define dataset with scenarios to test
  },
  "scorers": [
    // Define scoring functions that evaluate model outputs
  ]
}

export default config;
```

The exported configuration object has three high-level properties:

- `runs`: Use this to define [model providers](./models/basics)
- `dataset`: Use this to define the [scenarios to test](./dataset/basics)
- `scorers`: Use this to define [scoring functions](./scoring/basics)
