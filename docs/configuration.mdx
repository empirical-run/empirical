Empirical uses a JSON configuration file, called `empiricalrc.json`, to describe
the test to run. This configuration is declarative, in the sense that you define what you
want to test, and Empirical will internally implement the expected behavior.

## Configuration reference

The `empiricalrc.json` configuration file has two high-level properties:

- `runs`: Use this to define [model providers](./models/basics) and [scoring functions](./scoring/basics)
- `dataset`: Use this to define the [scenarios to test](./dataset/basics)

## Code editor integration

Your code editor can give you auto-completions and detect linting errors for this configuration
file. This uses a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition which is hosted by Empirical.

There are two ways to configure the schema definition.

### `$schema` property

Use the `$schema` property in the configuration file to specify the JSON schema URL.

```json empiricalrc.json
{
  "$schema": "https://assets.empirical.run/config/schema/latest.json",
  "runs": [
    // ...
  ],
  "dataset": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The above URL will always point to the JSON schema for the latest CLI version.
If you want to specify JSON schema for a particular CLI version, you can replace "latest" with the version number.

```json empiricalrc.json
{
  // https://assets.empirical.run/config/schema/v{CLI_VERSION_NUMBER}.json
  "$schema": "https://assets.empirical.run/config/schema/v0.4.0.json", 
  "runs": [
    // ...
  ],
  "dataset": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The easiest way to detect the CLI version is by running `npx @empiricalrun/cli -V` which will print the currently installed version number. 
You can then use that version number in the schema URL.

### Visual Studio Code

Add the `json.schemas` property to your VS Code configuration (user or workspace). This maps
the `empiricalrc.json` file to use the JSON schema.

```json settings.json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": [
        "empiricalrc.json"
      ],
      "url": "https://assets.empirical.run/config/schema/latest.json"
    }
  ]
}
```
