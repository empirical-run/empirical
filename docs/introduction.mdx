Empirical is the fastest way to test different LLMs and model configurations, across
all the scenarios that matter for your application.

[Quick start â†’](./quickstart)

## With Empirical, you can

- Run your test datasets locally against [off-the-shelf](./models/model) or [custom models](./models/custom)
- Compare model outputs on a web UI, and [test changes quickly](./reporter)
- Score your outputs with [scoring functions](./scoring/basics)
- Run [tests on CI/CD](./running-in-ci)

## Walk through

Watch a demo video showing Empirical run a text-to-SQL example with [TypeScript config](./config/typescript).
