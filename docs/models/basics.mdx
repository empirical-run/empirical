Empirical can test how different models and model configurations work for your
application. You can define which models and configurations to test in the
[configuration file](../configuration).

Empirical supports a few types of model providers:

## Hosted models

Popular models hosted by inference platforms (e.g. GPT-4o by OpenAI) can be
directly specified in the Empirical run configuration with type as `model`.

```json
"runs": [
  {
    "type": "model",
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "prompt": "Hey I'm {{user_name}}"
  }
]
```

- See how to [configure these models](./model)
- For OpenAI Assistants, see [the Assistant guide](./assistants)

## Custom scripts

For mature applications, or for those that require pre or post-processing around
the model API call, it is recommended to write a custom script provider. That way,
you can reference/import parts of your application and sharing code between your
app and tests.

- See [the Python guide](./custom) to configure models or apps defined as a Python module, with type `py-script`
