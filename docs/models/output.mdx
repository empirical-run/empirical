title: 'Output object'
description: 'Reference for the output object structure'
---

All model types return an output object which has the following
properties. This object is made available to the scoring functions.

## How to use this?

- **Generation**
  - Hosted models are pre-configured to respond with this object
  - If you are using [Custom scripts](../models/custom), the `execute` method is
    expected to return this object
- **Scoring**: If you are writing a [custom scorer in Python](../scoring/python), you can use this
  as a reference for the `output` object sent to the scorer.

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
