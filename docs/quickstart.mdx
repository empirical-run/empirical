Empirical bundles together a CLI and a web app. The CLI handles running tests and
the web app visualizes results.

Everything runs locally, with a JSON configuration file, `empiricalrc.json`.

Required: Node.js 20+ needs to be installed on your system.

## Start with a basic example

In this example, we will ask an LLM to parse user messages to extract entities and
give us a structured JSON output. For example, "I'm Alice from Maryland" will
become `"{name: 'Alice', location: 'Maryland'}"`.

Our test will succeed if the model outputs valid JSON.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Empirical">
    Use the CLI to create a sample configuration file in `empiricalrc.json`.

    ```sh
    npx @empiricalrun/cli init
    ```

    Read the file to see the configured models and dataset samples that we will test
    for. The default configuration uses models from OpenAI.

    ```sh
    cat empiricalrc.json
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the test">
    This step requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` to authenticate with OpenAI.
    
    Export `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable.

    ```sh
    export "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here"
    ```

    Run the test samples against the models with the `run` command.

    ```sh
    npx @empiricalrun/cli run
    ```

    This execution will cost ~$0.0026, based on the selected models.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See results">
    Use the `ui` command to open the reporter web app in your web browser and see
    side-by-side results.

    ```sh
    npx @empiricalrun/cli ui
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="[Bonus] Fix GPT-4 Turbo">
    GPT-4 Turbo tends to fail our JSON syntax check, because it returns outputs
   in markdown syntax (with backticks ` ```json `). We can fix this behavior by enabling
   [JSON mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode) in `empiricalrc.json` file.
   
    ```json
    {
      "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
      // ...
      // Existing properties
      "parameters": {
        "response_format": {
          "type": "json_object"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Accordion title="empiricalrc.json: Updated with JSON mode">
    ```json empiricalrc.json
    {
      "runs": [
        {
          "type": "model",
          "provider": "openai",
          "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          "prompt": "Extract the name, age and location from the message, and respond with a JSON object. If an entity is missing, respond with null.\n\nMessage: {{user_message}}",
          "scorers": [
            {
              "type": "is-json"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "model",
          "provider": "openai",
          "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
          "parameters": {
            "response_format": {
              "type": "json_object"
            }
          },
          "prompt": "Extract the name, age and location from the message, and respond with a JSON object. If an entity is missing, respond with null.\n\nMessage: {{user_message}}",
          "scorers": [
            {
              "type": "is-json"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "dataset": {
        "samples": [
          {
            "inputs": {
              "user_message": "Hi my name is John Doe. I'm 26 years old and I work in real estate."
            }
          },
          {
            "inputs": {
              "user_message": "This is Alice. I am a nurse from Maryland. I was born in 1990."
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    </Accordion>

    Re-running the test with `npx @empiricalrun/cli run` will give us better results
    for GPT-4 Turbo.

## Make it yours

Edit the `empiricalrc.json` file to make Empirical work for your use-case.

- Configure which [models to use](./models/basics)
- Configure [your test dataset](./dataset/basics)
- Configure [scoring functions](./scoring/basics) to grade output quality
