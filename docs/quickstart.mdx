Empirical bundles together a test runner and a web app, as the [test reporter](./reporter). These
can be used through the CLI in your terminal window.

Empirical relies on a configuration file, typically located at `empiricalrc.js`
which describes the test to run. This configuration is declarative, which means
that you define what you want to test, and Empirical will internally implement
the expected behavior.

> Required: Node.js 20+ needs to be installed on your system.

## Start with a basic example

In this example, we will ask an LLM to extract entities from user messages and
give us a structured JSON output. For example, "I'm Alice from Maryland" will
become `{name: 'Alice', location: 'Maryland'}`.

Our test will succeed if the model outputs valid JSON.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Empirical">
    Use the CLI to create a sample configuration file in `empiricalrc.js`.

    ```sh
    npm init empiricalrun

    # For TypeScript
    npm init empiricalrun -- --using-ts
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the test">
    Run the example dataset against the selected models.

    ```sh
    npx empiricalrun
    ```

    This step requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with
    OpenAI. This run will cost $0.0026, based on the selected models.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See results">
    Use the `ui` command to open the reporter web app and see side-by-side results.

    ```sh
    npx empiricalrun ui
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Make it yours

Edit the `empiricalrc.js` file to make Empirical work for your use-case.

- Configure which [models to use](./models/basics)
- Configure [your test dataset](./dataset/basics)
- Configure [scoring functions](./scoring/basics) to grade output quality
