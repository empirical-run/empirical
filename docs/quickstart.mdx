Empirical bundles together a CLI and a web app. The CLI handles running tests and
the web app visualizes results.

Everything runs locally, with a JSON configuration file, `empiricalrc.json`.

Required: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 20+ needs to be installed on your system.

## Start with a basic example

This example converts incoming unstructured user messages into structured JSON objects
using an LLM.

1. Use the CLI to create a sample configuration file called `empiricalrc.json`.

    ```sh
    npx @empiricalrun/cli init
    ```

2. Run the test samples against the models with the `run` command.

    ```sh
    npx @empiricalrun/cli run
    ```

3. Use the `ui` command to open the reporter web app in your web browser and see side-by-side results.

    ```sh
    npx @empiricalrun/cli ui
    ```

## Make it yours

Edit the `empiricalrc.json` file to make Empirical work for your use-case.

- Configure which [models to use](./models/basics)
- Configure [your test dataset](./dataset/basics)
- Configure [scoring functions](./scoring/basics) to grade output quality
