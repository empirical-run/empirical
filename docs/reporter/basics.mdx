After executing the test, you can access the results through a reporter.

Empirical provides 2 built-in reporter types:
- `terminal` : Displays test summary in the console.
- `webapp` : Launches a web server to view test summary in a browser.

## Terminal reporter
A terminal reporter presents a test summary in the console.
This summary is available immediately after running test samples using the `npx @empiricalrun/cli run` command.

The summary includes:
- Table containing statistical summaries for each configured run
- Total number of [dataset](./../dataset/basics) samples
- Duration of the test run
- Errors during the test run, if any

### Statistical summary
The summary table includes statistics for following metrics:
- `output` : Percentage of successful outputs from the run provider. A score lower than 100% means that there were instances where the run provider failed to respond.
- `scorer` : Average score of the configured [scorer](./../scoring/basics) represented in percentage.
    - This metric is shown for each configured [scorer](./../scoring/basics) separately by name.  


## Webapp reporter
The webapp reporter launches a local web server to view detailed summary of the runs in the browser.

To start the webapp reporter, run the following command after running the test:
```sh
npx @empiricalrun/cli ui
```

Running the above command will open a view on a browser similar to the following

The webapp reporter view contains:

    - `inputs` : A list of all [dataset](./../dataset/basics) test samples
    - `runs` : Outputs for each [run](./../configuration) configured
    - `statistics` : Statistical summary for each run

The webapp also allows you to:
- Modify [run](./../configuration) and execute it
- Delete a [run](./../configuration)

The webapp interactivity saves you the hassle of repeatedly navigating back to `empiricalrc.json` to configure, run and compare results. 
Using webapp, one can seamlessly modify, execute and delete [runs](./../configuration) in real-time, offering a much higher iteration speed and productivity.

### Modifying a run
A [run](./../configuration) configuration can be modified and executed in 2 steps:
<Steps>
    <Step title='Click "Show config" button next to the run'>
    A run configuration box will open, allowing you to update the prompt and other parameters of the config.
    You can update them as per your need.

  </Step>
  <Step title='Hit "Run"'>
    Click the "Run" button to execute the run with the updated parameters.

    Post execution, a new run will be added to the table, allowing you to compare the results side-by-side.
  </Step>

### Deleting a run
To delete a run, click on the `(-)` button next to the run you want to remove. This will permanently remove the run from the webapp.
