description: 'How to view results of a run'
---

After executing runs, you can access the results through a reporter.

Empirical provides 2 built-in reporter types:
- `Terminal` : displays summary of [runs](./../configuration#configuration-reference) in the console.
- `Web app` : launches a web server to view summary of [runs](./../configuration#configuration-reference) in a browser.

## Terminal reporter
A terminal reporter presents a summary of the runs in the console.

This summary is available immediately after the execution of the runs using the `npx @empiricalrun/cli run` command.

The summary includes:
- table containing statistical summaries for each configured run
- total number of [dataset](./../dataset/basics) samples
- duration of the run
- errors during the run, if any

### Statistical summary
The summary table includes statistics for following metrics:
- `output` : percentage of successful outputs from the run provider. A score lower than 100% means that there were instances where the run provider failed to respond.
- `scorer` : average score of the configured [scorer](./../scoring/basics) represented in percentage.
    - This metric is shown for each configured [scorer](./../scoring/basics) separately by name.  


## Web app reporter
The web app reporter launches a local web server to view detailed summary of the runs in the browser.

To start the web app reporter, run the following command after the execution of the runs using the `npx @empiricalrun/cli run` command:
```sh
npx @empiricalrun/cli ui
```

Running the above command will open a view on a browser similar to the following

The web app reporter view displays:
    - `inputs` : a list of all [dataset](./../dataset/basics) samples
    - `runs` : outputs for each run configured in `empiricalrc.json`
    - `statistics` : statistical summary for each run

Moreover, the web app allows you to:
- modify run configuration and execute it
- delete a run

The web app interactivity saves you the hassle of repeatedly navigating back to the `empiricalrc.json` file to configure, run and compare results. 
Using web app, one can seamlessly modify and delete runs in real-time, offering a much higher iteration speed and productivity.

### Modifying a run
A run can be modified and executed in quick simple steps:
<Steps>
    <Step title='Click "Show config" button next to the run'>
    A box will open, allowing you to update the prompt and parameters of the run.

    Update the parameters and prompt as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Hit "Run"'>
    Click the "Run" button to execute the run with the updated parameters.

    Post execution, a new run will be added to the table, allowing you to compare the results side-by-side.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting a run
To delete a run, click on the `(-)` button next to the run you want to remove. This will permanently remove the run from the webapp.
