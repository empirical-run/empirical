---

After executing tests, you can access the results through a reporter.

Empirical provides several built-in reporters:
{/* understand when backticks are used in docs */}
- `Terminal` : This displays test results in the console.
- `WebApp` : It launches a web server to view test results in a browser.


## Terminal reporter
As the name suggests it presents a summary of the test run on the terminal.
The summary includes:
- Table containing statistical summaries for each configured run specified in `empiricalrc.json`.
- Total number of samples tested
- Duration of the test run
- Errors during the test run, if any

### Statistical summary
The summary table includes statistics for following metrics:
- `output` : percentage of successful outputs from the run provider. A score lower than 100% means that there were instances where the run provider failed to respond.
- `scorer` : average score from the configured scoring function shown in percentage.
    - The scorer metrics are shown only if a scoring function is configured.
    - The scorer metrics are shown for each configured scoring function separately by scorer name.  


## WebApp reporter
The WebApp reporter launches a local web server to view detailed test results in the browser.
It displays:
    - `inputs` : a list of all dataset samples tested.
    - `runs` : outputs for each run configured in `empiricalrc.json`
    - `statistics` : statistical summary for each run

Additionally, the webapp is interactive to allow users to:
- Modify parameters of the test run and re-execute it
- Delete a test run

The WebApp interactivity saves you the hassle of repeatedly navigating back to the `empiricalrc.json` file to configure and compare results. 
One can seamlessly edit and delete test runs in real-time, offering a much higher iteration speed and productivity.

### Modifying a run
{/* rephrase this in steps */}
A run can be modified in 2 quick simple steps
<Steps>
    <Step title='Click on the "Show config" button next to the run'>
    A box will open, allowing you to update the prompt and parameters of the run.

    Update the parameters and prompt as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Hit "Run"'>
    Click the "Run" button to execute the test with the updated parameters.

    Post execution, a new run will be added to the table, allowing you to compare the results side-by-side.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting a run
To delete a run, click on the `(-)` button next to the run you want to remove. This will permanently remove the run from the webapp.
