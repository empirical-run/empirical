description: 'Write a custom scoring function with Python'
---

You can configure a custom Python evaluator by specifying a `py-script` evaluator in
the `scorers` section of the configuration. The `path` key should be the path to the Python script.

```json
"scorers": [
  {
    "type": "py-script",
    "path": "score.py",
    "name": "my-custom-scorer"
  }
]
```

In the script, you need to define an `evaluate` method, with the following signature:

- **Arguments**
  - output: dict with key `value` to get the output value (string) and key `metadata` to get metadata (dict)
  - inputs: dict of key-value pairs from the dataset sample
- **Returns**
  - List of results: each result is dict with score (number between 0 to 1), message (optional, string) and name (optional, string)

```python score.py
def evaluate(output, inputs):
    model_response = output["value"]
    metadata = output["metadata"]
    # ... score the model response
    return {
        "score": 1,
        "message": "Optional reasoning for this score"
    }
```

## Multiple scores

It is possible for the Python script to return an array of scores. Use `name` to distinguish
between them.

```python score.py
def evaluate(output, inputs):
    model_response = output["value"]
    metadata = output["metadata"]
    # ... score the model response
    return [
      { "score": 1, "name": "syntax-score" },
      { "score": 0, "name": "semantic-score", "message": "failure reason"}
    ]
```

## Example

The [HumanEval example](https://github.com/empirical-run/empirical/tree/main/examples/humaneval) uses this scorer.

## Python Path

The Python script is executed on your machine using `python` available in `PATH`. This
determines the Python version that is used.

The Python script can use any Python modules (built-in or third party). If you are
using third-party libraries or want to use a specific version of Python, override
the Python path while running the CLI.

```sh
npx empiricalrun --python-path PATH_TO_PYTHON_BINARY
```

## Limitations

- The Python script must complete execution within 10 seconds
- `async` Python functions are not supported
