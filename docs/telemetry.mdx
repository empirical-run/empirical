title: 'Telemetry'
---

The Empirical CLI collects anonymous telemetry for product usage. This information is used
to understand user behavior and shape the product roadmap.

This telemetry is strictly anonymous: we don't collect any information that can be used to
identify you or your company. Our code is open source, and we encourage you to validate
this, if that's required.

You can opt-out of telemetry collection by setting the following environment variable while 
running CLI commands.

```sh
EMPIRICAL_TELEMETRY=0
```
